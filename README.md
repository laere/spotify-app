# spotify-app

Using the Spotify API as a single source of truth. 

Goal: Implement and further understand the Redux library, managing state, and how to truly build fast applications. 

Middleware (in order): redux-thunk, redux-promise-middleware.

Immutable data: dot-prop library.

Talking to the API: Axios.
